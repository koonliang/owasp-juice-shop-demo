# Project Documentation & Context Files

This directory contains context preservation files to maintain project state across Claude Code sessions.

## Files Overview

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `CURRENT_STATE.txt` | Current project status snapshot | Every major milestone |
| `SESSION_HANDOFF.txt` | End-of-session summary | End of each session |
| `COMMANDS_LOG.txt` | Successful commands library | As commands are discovered |
| `DECISIONS.txt` | Why technical choices were made | When decisions are made |
| `ISSUES.txt` | Known problems & workarounds | As issues are found/resolved |

## How to Use

### Starting a New Session
```
Claude, read /docs/CURRENT_STATE.txt and /docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.txt
Then summarize what we should work on next.
```

### Ending a Session
```
Update /docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.txt with:
- What we completed
- Next steps
- Any blockers
```

### During Work
- Add successful commands to `COMMANDS_LOG.txt`
- Document decisions in `DECISIONS.txt`
- Track issues in `ISSUES.txt`
- Update `CURRENT_STATE.txt` when completing major tasks

## Best Practices

1. **Keep CURRENT_STATE.txt updated** - It's your session startup file
2. **Always update SESSION_HANDOFF.txt** - Write it like you're briefing your future self
3. **Document WHY, not just WHAT** - Future you will thank you
4. **Real examples > Abstract templates** - Fill in with actual project data
5. **Review periodically** - Archive old content to keep files manageable

## Tips

- These files are meant to be living documents
- Don't worry about perfect formatting - clarity > perfection
- Use these as conversation starters with Claude Code
- Reference line numbers when telling Claude what to read
- Keep sensitive data out - use references to secret stores instead
